Project to creating a GUI related to Windowing Systems class work. This is a calculator has a standard, scientific and game mode. 

*Unfinished work*

Using JavaFX and JavaFXML, I created a calculator.
User can switch between scientific and standard calculator. 
User may change the settings of the calculators appearance for that instance. Settings reset after each mode change.
Scientifc calculator can only do one function at a time such as tan(90). I have not added the capabilities of reading a string such as tan (50 + 40)
Game mode currently does not display results.
  Game is a simple mental math game where users may select difficulty and operation they would like
  When mouse enters text box, the answer shall appear, but this functionality currently does not work.
